One, two! And through and through</p><p>   The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!</p><p> He left it dead, and with its head</p><p>   He went galumphing back.</p><br><p> "And, has thou slain the Jabberwock?</p><p>   Come to my arms, my beamish boy!</p><p> O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'</p><p>   He chortled in his joy.</p><br><p>  `Twas brillig, and the slithy toves</p><p>    Did gyre and gimble in the wabe</p><p></p><p>  All mimsy were the borogoves,</p><br><p>  And the mome raths outgrabe.</p><p>
